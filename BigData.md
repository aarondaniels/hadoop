# Big Data
As the data science industry continues to shift toward adopting giant data warehouses in place of relatively simple databases, new approaches to data management are needed. 

This change is a direct result of more powerful computer systems and software platforms that use large amounts of data to train machine learning (ML) models. As ML becomes more powerful and widespread, the data used to train the models must adapt as well. Data is the backbone to a successful predictive modeling tool, and the cleaner and more organized the incoming dataset is, the more accurate the ML algorithm will be. 

## What Defines Big Data?

Big data comes in many forms. For example, Facebook keeps a log of every click that users make on their app, and Tesla uploads the longitude, latitude, and velocity of their entire fleet to their remote servers. These implementations, at scale, account for terabytes of data per day being transmitted and processed. Such massive data flows cannot be handled with traditional data processing software, so new tools are designed for the task. These new tools have the five V’s of big data in common.

## The Five V’s of Big Data 

|         |        |
|---------|--------|
| Value	| Big data is practically useless until its value is discovered. Many organizations collect vast amounts of data, and much of it stays in databases until the organization can figure out how to use it effectively to its advantage. New technologies have made it inexpensive to store large amounts of data, and this is now common practice industry-wide. |
| Variety	| Data must be accepted in many forms. Variety means large amounts of data can arrive in structured or semi-structured formats. Video feed is a semi-structured type of data that must be processed and broken down so a machine can make sense of the images. This adds yet another layer of complexity. |
| Velocity	| With smart devices becoming more powerful, the rate at which data is received increases dramatically. This means large amounts of data are loaded into a device's memory — typically within milliseconds — and are expected to be processed nearly instantly. For example, when a car is running on autopilot, it must load and process gigabytes of sensor data within fractions of a second, or the car may hit an object and put safety at risk. |
| Veracity	| Data must be accurate and truthful. When collecting big data, care must be taken to ensure that it is representative of all aspects of the business. This is important because inaccurate data can produce biased results when implementing business solutions. |
| Volume	| Big data arrives in massive volumes. This can mean terabytes of unstructured data, such as clickstreams from apps or websites, sensor data from vehicles, video streams from security cameras, and much more. |

## Big Data Use Cases 

There are a number of ways that big data can be used in different industries. Some major ways that big data can shape customer experiences and business analytics include the following scenarios:

***Product Development***: Social media organizations develop products that need to interpret data and predict what users are going to want to see next. For example, YouTube develops entire algorithms to predict what users want to watch as their video ends. To ensure accurate suggestions, the predictive algorithms must take many factors into consideration, such as previously watched videos, what a user tends to click on next, or even why some users choose to close the application after a video finishes.
***Predictive Maintenance***: Being able to predict when a product will have a mechanical failure is vital in today’s economy. Predicting failure is important especially with more complex systems, such as those required by modern vehicles. Predictive algorithms take in large amounts of data periodically and try to anticipate when and how a product will fail so that preventative maintenance can be scheduled.
***Customer Experience***: Tracking website views, call logs, and social media posts enables organizations to provide a better customer experience. For example, customer experience algorithms can predict the average hold time a customer will have to wait on a call, which can lead to better staffing in customer service centers.
***Operational Efficiency***: Amazon uses big data in order to understand customer shopping trends. Big data enables Amazon to ship a package within a day because they have analytical tools that can predict what people are going to need and order before the customers realize it themselves.
***Medical Innovation***: Having access to a large patient dataset allows universities and institutions to examine causes of illness to a degree that was not previously possible. Simply storing and analyzing millions of common patient temperature readings allows for insights and critical medical breakthroughs.
